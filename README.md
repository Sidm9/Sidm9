### Howdy!! ðŸ‘‹


I am a software engineer at A7ALABS.
I specialize in digital strategy, project management, and development. I have been at this developing Websites, Webapps and Mobile Apps for a good four years, and have sharpened my skills working actively over 10 projects.
With every project, I implement the highest standards of communication and collaboration, and believe that process is the foundation of success.
